# Lagrangian Example

Sample code to showcase:
* Mathematical Programming and Mixed-Integer Programming
* Lagrangian decomposition
* Stochastic programming

applied to "power plant scheduling problem" a.k.a. the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP).

The code has been used to produce content for some of my talks. See pdf `ATaverna_DLI_2022.pdf` for the 
[talk](https://talks.codemotion.com/operations-research-the-scalable-ai-for-?view=true) at
DeepLearningItalia / CodemotionItaly in 2022 (audio in Italian)


# Usage

Install requirements via `requirements.txt`.

Content is in runnable notebooks:
* `Knapsack` for knapsack problem
* `UCP`, `UCP_Lagrangian` and `UCP_Stochastic` for UCP.
* `Non-smooth Dual Example` shows an example of non-smooth problem, written in Markdown/LaTeX
